# 18 - PEASMD
OK, I'll admit, this solution is a little cheesy. And it wasn't my idea, I got it from some chatter in the LRR discord.

The idea is: rather than try to parse these expressions ourself, we're already using a language that can do mathematical expressions, just give it to that.

So all we do is create new addition and multiplication operators, that work the same as the normal ones, except we diddle with their fixity so that they get parsed in the order(s) we want.

To that end, a thrown-together shell script that takes the input file and `sed`s it into the appropriate Haskell code (changing the operators, and turning it into a list), which we then compile and run. In an interpreted language we could do this on the fly with `eval` but as a compiled language Haskell doesn't have that function.

One minor hitch is that our `sed` script turns the text input into a list by adding a comma to the end of each line. But Haskell doesn't like trailing commas in lists. But the puzzle wants us to get the sum of all the puzzle results, so we can just add an extra `0` to the end of the list after the final comma, to make it parse without affecting the result.
