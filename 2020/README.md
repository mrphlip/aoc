# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

I use these types of challenges as an excuse to learn (or brush up on) programming languages I'm not particularly familiar with. But this year has been draining, so I'm going to extend from my work last year, and continue to use Haskell.

So don't expect this code to be particularly efficient, clean, or idiomatic.

But, it works.

For each puzzle, eg `01.hs` is my code, and `01.txt` is my version of the data file from AOC. `01.md` is my comments on the puzzle, and my solution for it. Some common code between the puzzles has been collected in `../Utils.hs`.
