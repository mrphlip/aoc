Not a lot to talk about here. Just another puzzle that's trivialised by the existance of a `Set` datatype.

But I'm getting concerned about the variety of plane that is servicing the north pole. The largest real-life passenger plane in service, the A380, usually holds 525 passengers, and is rated to hold as many as 850 if you really cram 'em in. And to do that, it has a two-storey interior. And yet, we're supposed to believe that, in the plane we boarded in yesterday's puzzle, we were fitting 810 passangers onto a plane that, according to its seat numbering scheme, isn't a multi-level structure.

And, like, normally I would have made a joke about them being elves, so you can cram more of them into a smaller space, but we learned _two_ days ago that they're all normal human heights. Or at least, that's what it says on their passports.

And now, today, the puzzle says we're transferring at a regional airport into a _larger_ plane? And for this puzzle I'm collating the survey responses of 1662 passengers? The size of these planes is getting out of hand...
