# 1 &ndash; Balancing the books
I'll be honest, I solved this one in Python at first, because it was like 2am when I was reminded that AoC existed, and I wanted to get this done quickly so I could get to sleep. This is the same strategy, ported to Haskell.

It's a pretty direct algorithm, the only real speedup over the dumb algorithm is in storing the data as a `Set` rather than a list, so that checking each possibility is faster.
