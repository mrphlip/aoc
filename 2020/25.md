This is just straight-up Diffie-Hellman.

When I was actually working on it, I wasn't entirely sure, it could have been something similar, just a simplification of DH, but I figured it was close enough that it probably wasn't worth trying to figure out anything smart to crack the private keys... if the forward operation is to raise a number to a power with a modulus, then nothing of value is going to be found in trying to find a clever way to invert that. People much smarter than me have tried.

It did, however, let me pull in a `Modulo` type that I'd worked on before, and in particular this lets me do the _forward_ version of the transform using Haskell's builtin `(^)` which does exponentiation-by-squaring, so it's noticibly faster than the naive approach. But that doesn't help much with the inverse transform, which is still just a brute-force search. The one speedup we have is iterating through the state space once, and checking _both_ public keys, to see which one decodes first (ie, which one has the lower private key), because we only need to crack one of the two keys.

Ultimately, it doesn't take that long to run (about a quarter of a second) because 20201227 isn't _that_ big a prime.
