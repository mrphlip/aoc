# 9 &ndash; More sum-finding
The first part of this uses basically the same algorithm from puzzle 1 &ndash; checking each option, using a `Set` to check if its requisite counterpart is also in the list.

The second part is a little more complicated, but we can use a simplifying step &ndash; if we make a list of the cumulative totals from our original list, then any number that we can get from our original list as a sum of a consecutive range, can also be gotten from our cumulative list as the difference of two terms. This means we can just try to find two terms that differ by our target amount, which uses the same algorithm as before. Except with a bit more processing as we need to be able to get back to _where_ those two numbers are in the list, rather than the actual numbers themselves, so we use a `Map` of value to original index, rather than a `Set`. But the spirit is the same.
