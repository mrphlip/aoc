# 12 &ndash; Just as good as Apple Maps
This was a fun puzzle, mostly because I got to reuse the vector-maths module I'd made for [puzzle 12 last year](../2019/12.md) that I ended up having to remove for the second half of that puzzle. It's nice that it's finally actually in use again.

With that handled, all that's left is the work of writing the code to handle each operation, determine the result, and try not to get mixed up as to whether I made North or South as the positive direction on the Y axis. Don't ask me how I know that the last point is a challenge.
