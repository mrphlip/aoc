# 5 &ndash; This is a very big plane
The main part of this puzzle is just in reading the input... converting these weird codes into seat ids. But then, the trick to recognise is that the binary-search algorithm that is presented in the puzzle is just ordinary binary numbers.

Take one of the examples they give: `BBFFBBFRLL`, which is row 102, column 4, seat ID 820. Well, in binary, 102 is `1100110`, 4 is `100`, and 820 is `1100110100`, which you'll recognise as being identical to the seating code's first part, second part, and entire thing, respectively, just with the various letters replaced with 1s and 0s. And this makes sense - if you take a bunch of 10-digit binary numbers, the ones that start with 1 are in the upper half, and the ones that start with 0 are in the lower half, etc. So in order to process these codes, we don't need to do any of this halving and binary-search stuff, we just convert the letters into bits, and read it as a binary number.

This was hampered somewhat by discovering that Haskell core libs seemingly don't include a function for converting from binary strings, only decimal, so I quickly threw one together for my Utils module.

Once we have that, and we have our list of seat ids, solving the actual puzzles are pretty trivial. The first is just getting the maximum from our list, and the second is just stepping through the list after sorting it, to find the one that's missing (which can be done in any of a number of ways).
