# 24 &ndash; Cellular automata come in threes
And now, our third cellular automaton for the year. This one, on a hex grid, which is different, but once you pick a coordinate system it's not that challenging. Especially compared to the earlier one that was on the 4-grid.

Used a different strategy for this one... for the past cellular automata, I worked on a big rectangular array that was the size of the grid... this time, since the starting set seemed relatively sparse, I decided to instead work with a `Set` of all the active points. Upside: don't need to worry about the size of the array expanding out of control just because there's one active cell cluster off in the distance. Downsides: honestly, none are springing to mind immediately. Probably should be doing it this way all the time. Code's smaller, too. Might be slower if the grid is particularly dense? But honestly I'm not immediately sure that's the case anyway. Should probably just do any future cellular automata puzzles like this too.
