# 4 &ndash; Crasping for a good record type
Still not much of challenge from a computational front, the main hard part here is representing all this passport data in a succinct datatype within Haskell.

In my usual language, of Python, I'd just store the different fields in a dict, but that doesn't seem in keeping with a more strictly typed language? It feels like I _should_ be using a more statically-defined record type here. But then, that leads to the mess of `addField` here, as we have to individually map the strings in the input to the fields in our record type.

I feel like this strategy of learning languages via programming challenges is neat for learning the basics of how to write for a language, but not so much how to write _idiomatically_ for a language...
