# 17 &ndash; Cellular automata again, but _more_
And so we have, again, a cellular-automaton puzzle. It's even actually Game of Life rules, this time. Except, the multi-dimension thing.

My solution here is straight-up the direct approach. Make the grid, calculate the neighbours for each cell, to calculate the successor grid. Expanding the grid by 1 in every direction at each step, to account for the pattern's growth.

There are definitely optimisations that could be done. For instance, the pattern doesn't necessarily actually expand in _every_ direction at maximum speed, so the bounds could be shrunk after each generation. But this solution calculates fast enough that I wasn't required to figure out any of those optimisations.

For the second part, because of Haskell's typefulness, it's hard to work with tuples in a sort of general way... writing code that works the same for 3-value tuples and 4-value tuples can be a pain. It could be done, but I was too lazy to do it... so the second part is basically just a direct copy-paste of the first part, with a few small tweaks to add the extra dimension.
