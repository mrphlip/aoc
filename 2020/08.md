# 8 &mdash; Oh no, not again
This puzzle was made somewhat easier by virtue of having spent so much time last year working on the Intcode machine. This machine is obviously nowhere near as complex as that one (the code isn't self-modifying, opcodes are all the same size, etc), but that did give me the basic structure &ndash; define an program type, and a state type, and a function to calculate the next state from a given one, and then unfold to victory.

The main improvement I made here from what I learned last time, is to have an explicit state to represent the halt condition (and, in this case, the looped condition). So rather than having `nextState` return `Nothing` when it enters a halt state, it instead returns `Halted`, and then `nextState` on `Halted` _then_ returns `Nothing`. Makes some things a little bit cleaner... and in particular, means we can put data there to distinguish different reasons for halting (ie halt-state vs looped).

I'm just hoping this is a one-off puzzle, and this machine won't be returning a-la Intcode... I really don't want to do that whole routine again.
