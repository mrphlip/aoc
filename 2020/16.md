# 16 &ndash; Everyone loves a good logic grid
I... was kinda dreading this one. When I solved this the first time around, I used some quick scripts to check all the different ranges, but then I generated the logic puzzle grid and solved it by hand. And the idea of trying to solve it programmatically? In a functional language? I wasn't too looking forward to that.

But turns out, it wasn't quite as bad as I feared. It still wasn't great, but I got there. The fundamental idea isn't too hard: find an option which is the only available option in its row or column, and mark all the _other_ positions in its column/row as _not_ options, and repeat until the whole grid is reduced to a single option in each row/column. But actually implementing that algorithm was a bit of work.

So much so that I didn't even try to attempt this, on that day... it wasn't until after I'd solved day 17 that I came back and solved this one as well.

Feels good to have it done, though.

One thing I did do, though, is the code for checking if a number is in one of the ranges... which I did overengineer somewhat (though there's definitely still room for improvement to make it even more complicated) but I thought came together quite nicely.
