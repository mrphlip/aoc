# 11 &ndash; Conway's game of ferries
Oh man, everyone loves cellular automata!

So, the premise here is pretty simple: build an array to hold the grid, build a function to iterate to the next grid state, and loop that until we reach a fixed point.

Part 2 was an interesting twist, as the idea of what each node considers "neighbours" is not the part I was expecting to change between parts, so plugging that required some amount of gutting of the code. But not too much.
