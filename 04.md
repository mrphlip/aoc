# 4 - Password crackers
Not a lot of excitement here, mostly just implementing the rules directly as spelled out.

Ony real trick here is mapping a function over `zip s (tail s)` which is a trick I've also used in Python for iterating over pairs of consecutive elements in a list. No idea whether that's actually good or just fancy, but I like it.

Using `zip4 s (tail s) (tail$tail s) (tail$tail$tail s)` to sweep across 4 consecutive elements is probably excessive, especially when the strings are only 6 digits long anyway.
