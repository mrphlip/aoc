# 13 &ndash; It's so bouncy
Well that was a heck of a thing.

Part A was pretty trivial, just run the program, interpret the results, count up the appropriate cells. Nothing we can't do, especially since we have our handy expanding-array code to handle the fact that we're not told how big the screen is.

Part B, though... part B was a problem.

The problem is that, with how my interpreter is currently built, it doesn't have a way to _request_ input from the world. Instead it's provided a list of inputs, and it reads values from that as needed. Now, we could still have the inputs depend on the previous outputs, thanks to magical Haskell laziness, but there hasn't been a mechanism to keep that in sync. The external system has just had to know the correct number of outputs to read, before calculating the next input. Read too few and you might calculate the wrong input due to not having enough context... read too many and the process will crash as the laziness breaks down &ndash; the interact code tries to read the next output, so it needs to run the intcode machine long enough to generate another output, so it hits an input instruction, so it tries to read the next input, so it needs to run the interact code until it generates another input, and now we have a loop of strict operations and Haskell will give up.

So we need some way for the machine to signal that it's outputted all the info it's going to output, and it's about to try to read an input, so the interact function can stay in sync.

My first thought was to see if there was any sort of signal in the actual machine that I could use... like maybe it always writes the score, and then gets an input after that, or something. But no such luck &ndash; there's only one "input" opcode in the machine, but it's jumped to from several different locations.

Second thought was to change the interpreter to output some sort of signal whenever an input is requested, but that's not the greatest solution since then every other program (including past days) that depend on input would also have to deal with this additional sentinel value, that would kinda suck.

So instead I did something that was probably not a particularly good idea, but it works &ndash; I patched the Intcode machine itself, so that it outputs `-2` just before polling for input. Then my interact function could key off that to start generating its inputs, and as a bonus I could write a display function that paused briefly whenever it read a `-2` for a frame-delay, in order to show the screen as an animation in the terminal.

Making that patch wasn't simple... ideally I'd want to take the `3,384` in the code, and replace it with `104,-2,3,384` to output my signal and then read. But that replacement is _bigger_ and we can't move all the following instructions down by 2 as Intcode uses a lot of absolute addressing. So instead we need to relocate it out... replace the input with `1106,0,10000`, an unconditional jump to a part of memory the program probably isn't touching, and then in that location we put `104,-2,3,384,1106,0,[return address]`. But even _that_ is too big, so we have to relocate the _next_ instruction into the thunk too. So the full patch is to replace `3,384,[next instruction]` with `1106,0,10000,[padding]`, and then at 10000 we have `104,-2,3,384,[next instruction],1106,0,[return address]`.

It's all very delicate, and would likely only work with the specific Intcode machine I received &ndash; machines generated for other users might have the input instruction in a different location, depending on how these are generated (but there's probably still only one of them, and its context is probably still the same).

,,, or, at least, that's what I did [at first](https://github.com/mrphlip/aoc2019/blob/3131f64004e50f9fda7ccb290f2e5254fdb9be76/13.hs)... after doing that and getting everything working, I realised I was being dumb, and went back to that second thought of making the interpereter automatically output a signal when it's ready to read an input, and add a flag to the interpreter state to turn that on and off, so when it's off it behaves the same as it always has, and the other days' programs are safe. So much simpler, so much less of a hack. It wasn't even that hard to do, thanks to the work back on day 11 to move everything that touches the internals of the state into Intcode.hs, so adding new state fields is trivial. But it makes me feel less Cleverâ„¢ to have done it. Such is the tradeoff as a programmer, sometimes.

One other complication is that my previous implementation of IO for Intcode wasn't quite as lazy as I'd hoped. It seemed to generally work, but having an output immediately followed by an input, didn't give the loop enough iterations for something to propagate out or something? I'm not 100% sure what the problem was, but I couldn't read all the outputs all the way to the &minus;2 before calculating my input. So I needed to rearrange the output code to... ultimately, what I should have done in the first place. Now `icstep` takes a machine state and returns the next machine state _and_ the step's output, if anything. And then `icrun` collects all the outputs and returns it as a lazily-iterable list. Ultimately, cleaner and more correct than what I was doing before, even if it does mean that `icrun` doesn't use `unfoldr` any more (which is a shame, I like `unfoldr`, it's neat).
