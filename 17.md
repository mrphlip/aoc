# Pattern recognition
This one... turned out to be a lot easier to solve by hand, than to figure out how to solve it generally...

Part A is pretty simple - get the program's output, read it in, count the tiles of floor that have >2 neighbouring floor tiles. Mostly a challenge in parsing the Intcode output as ASCII.

Part B, though... I solved it by hand with a number of simplifying assumptions based on how the maze appears to be generated. Generalising it would be a challenge.

But based on the assumptions that (a) all the intended subpatterns are some number of repetitions of "one turn, one move count, one turn, one move count, ..." and that the intended route is not self-overlapping (other than going straight-through at intersections) then the final route isn't too hard to figure out, and the intended separation into subpatterns wasn't too hard to figure out by hand. But generalising this, especially if you _don't_ include those simplifying assumptions, would be a _lot_ harder.

I may come back at some point and solve this programmattically, leaving the assumptions in (but actually codifying them), but for now this has a hard-coded hand-rolled solution (and thus will not be useful for anyone else's input).
