# 1 &ndash; Smoothing the data
Another nice and simple first puzzle, getting our feet wet.

Main points of interest in this solution are the idiom of `zip xs (tail xs)` to scan through a list with a two-element window, to compare each value to its neighbour, and also recognising that the second part boils down to just comparing the value that's _entering_ the smoothing window with the one that is _existing_ it, so we can skip the smoothing and just directly compare values that are 3 apart.
