# 7 &ndash; A rather average puzzle
This one was interesting, because it _should_ be possible to solve it directly by analysis. For the first part, the ideal target position is the median of the input values (if there's an even number of input values, then anywhere between the two middle values will work the same). And for the second part, it should be _roughly_ the mean of the values, as the cost is _roughly_ the square of the distance (and so the total cost is _roughly_ the variance).

However, given that it's not _exactly_ the mean, and also the target value has to be an integer (which the mean isn't)... I decided it was more effort than it was worth to solve this analytically, and just stuck with the direct brute-force method of calculating it for every position in the range, and finding the best option.
