# 2 &ndash; Smoothing the data
The first half of this one is pretty simple, as all of the steps are interchangeable... you can just pull out all the horizontal steps and all the vertical steps, and add them up separately.

The second half, however, is not so easy, since the effect of each `forward` step depends on the current state. There would be ways to do it that were a bit "cleverer" (like, pull out all the vertical operations and `scan` over those to make a list of partial-sums for the aim, then zip that with the horizontal operations to calculate the actual movement) but really it didn't save much and was quite a bit more work, so I just went with the direct state-passing `fold`.
