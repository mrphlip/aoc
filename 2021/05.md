# 5 &ndash; Some of these vent courses, intersecting at crosses
The strategy here is reasonably simple: for each of the lines, we make a list of all of the grid points that line touches, and then count up, for each point, how many times it appears in the combined list.

Threw together a utility function to combine together the points, based of Python's `collections.Counter` class, which builds a dictionary of values to counts, and increments the count for each value as it comes in.

There is also a bit of complication for listing all the grind points touched by the diagonal lines, which is still a little messy, but my solution hinges on having a flag variable to indicate the slope of the diagonal (either `1` or `-1`) and using this as a multiplier on the counter &ndash; if the slope is `1`, then as the `x` value increases, the `y` should also increase, while if the slope is `-1` then as the `x` value increases, the `y` value should decrease. So, indexing the points as `x+i` and `y+i*slope` would count in the right direction according to the slope. (The actual formula used in the code is a little different to this, as it's re-arranged so that `x` is the free variable, since that matched up better with the other code already written.)
