# 3 &ndash; Crunching the bits
This was an interesting puzzle... none of the things that it needs done are, individually, all that complicated. But their combination is weird, you spend half the time just rereading the puzzle, trying to get your head around exactly what weird sequence of events it wants you to do. But once you figure it out, it's not that hard to put it all together.
