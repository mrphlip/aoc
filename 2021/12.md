# 12 &ndash; 1 path through the maze, ah, ah, ah...
I missed this one at launch, and then when I went back to look at it afterwards I saw the description and just... no, I'd rather not, thank you. So I left this one for a while, and only went back to it after day 16.

Turns out it wasn't as bad as I feared &ndash; the maze in the input is small enough, that I got away with not memoizing the path-counting function... so if it revisits a node, with the same state, it'll still walk through every path from that node again. It essentially brute-forces every possible path through the maze, without any cleverness. And yet it's still able to solve both parts of the puzzle in about a quarter of a second. But it would definitely struggle on a maze that was a bit larger, and there is definitely room for improvement, performance-wise.
