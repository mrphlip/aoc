# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

I use these types of challenges as an excuse to learn (or brush up on) programming languages I'm not particularly familiar with. I'm continuing my trend from the past couple of years and continuing to practice with Haskell, a language I'm only somewhat familiar with.

So don't expect this code to be particularly efficient, clean, or idiomatic.

But, it works.

For each puzzle, there are several files:
* `01.hs` is my code to solve the puzzle.
* `01.txt` is my version of the data file from AOC.
* `01.md` is my diary of comments on the puzzle, and my thoughts on the solution.
* `01.py` is the code I wrote while racing for the leaderboard, unpolished (not available for every puzzle).

Some common code between the puzzles has been collected in `../Utils.hs`.

The diary pages also include my leaderboard positions for the puzzles for which I was able to be around when the puzzle opened, to race for the charts. I'm not able to do this every day, as in my timezone they open during business hours and sometimes work just gets in the way. But I enjoy it when they do. When I'm racing for the chart, often I'll do my first attempt in Python, as it's a language I'm much more familiar with (and can code in quickly), and only after I've submitted my solution, I'll go back and re-solve the puzzle in Haskell.
