# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

I use these types of challenges as an excuse to learn (or brush up on) programming languages I'm not particularly familiar with. I'm continuing my trend from the past couple of years and continuing to practice with Haskell, a language I'm only somewhat familiar with.

So don't expect this code to be particularly efficient, clean, or idiomatic.

But, it works.

For each puzzle, eg `01.hs` is my code, and `01.txt` is my version of the data file from AOC. `01.md` is my comments on the puzzle, and my solution for it. Some common code between the puzzles has been collected in `../Utils.hs`.
