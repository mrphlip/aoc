# 9 &ndash; Flooding in the valley
This puzzle is quite interesting, from a puzzle-design point of view... because the description of the puzzle implies a lot of things about the structure of the heightmap.

In particular, the requirement that every point that isn't a `9` will always flow into exactly one basin means that the boundary between any two basins _must_ be lined with `9`s. Otherwise, you'd have a structure like `012343210` where the `4` in the middle is ambiguous as to which basin it "belongs" to. So the heightmap must be a bunch of regions bounded by `9`s, and then each region has a single local-minimum point within it.

So you _could_ solve this puzzle by ignoring all the stuff about smoke flowing downhill, and instead just divide the grid up into regions based on the `9`s, and then take the minimum value in each region (for part 1) and find the size of each region (for part 2).

Ultimately, that's not what I did, and my solution goes a bit more by-the-books to find its answers &ndash; for part 1, I scan the grid to find all the local minima, and for part 2, I do a flood fill from each local minimum, hill-climbing in every direction, until it hits the wall of `9`s, to find the size of the basin.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do this one right as it was released. I still timed myself, and I believe I _would_ have gotten [55/17] based on my times, but that's just an estimate and in reality I got no points for this one.
