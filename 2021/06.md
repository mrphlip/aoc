# 6 &ndash; Lanternfish parthenogenesis
A classic recurrence problem... the first part, I solved exactly as described in the puzzle: having a list of numbers, one for each lanternfish, and then decrementing them all, and appending a bunch of 8s for the newly-born fish. But obviously that won't fly for the second part... if the answer they give for the sample problem is almost 27 billion, then the naive solution must end with a list of 27 billion entries! Not feasible.

The natrual next step is to recognise that we don't need to keep track of each individual fish, just their counts. Keep a count of how many fish are at each timer value, and that's all you need. Now you don't need a list of 27 billion entries, but just a list of 9 entries which _sum_ to 27 billion. Much more feasible.

From a discussion in Discord, it was suggested that this could be directly solved analytically, to give a closed form... since this is a simple linear recurrence, it can be [converted to a closed form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_recurrence_with_constant_coefficients#Solution_to_homogeneous_case). If we define `a[n]` as the number of lanternfish which will give birth on day `n`, then our recurrence is `a[n] = a[n-6] + a[n-8]`. And it _is_ possible to find a closed form for `a[n]`. However, part of the process for that involves finding the roots of the 8th-degree polynomial `x^8 - x^2 - 1 = 0`. This is still not impossible, as it's actually a quartic polynomial in `x^2`, and a quartic equation does exist... but it's not particularly useful.

[Wolfram|Alpha is able to solve this polynomial](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x%5E8+-+x%5E2+-+1+%3D+0), but the result looks like this:
![x = sqrt(1/2 sqrt((1/2 (9 + sqrt(849)))^(1/3)/3^(2/3) - 4 (2/(3 (9 + sqrt(849))))^(1/3)) + 1/2 sqrt(4 (2/(3 (9 + sqrt(849))))^(1/3) - (1/2 (9 + sqrt(849)))^(1/3)/3^(2/3) + 2/sqrt((1/2 (9 + sqrt(849)))^(1/3)/3^(2/3) - 4 (2/(3 (9 + sqrt(849))))^(1/3))))](07_roots.png)
And that's just the two real roots, the other 6 roots are complex and are even worse.

So yeah, theoretically possible, but perhaps not ideal.
