# 10 &ndash; Putting another puzzle onto the stack
Matching pairs of brackets is an old classic, for handling with a stack. Read through the string from left to right, and for each opening bracket, push that bracket type onto the stack, and for each closing bracket, pop it off the stack, so the stack is a representation of how many nested brackets you're currently inside. If you ever get a closing bracket that doesn't match the head of the stack, or you try to pop off an empty stack, then you have mismatched brackets, so that's part 1. If you get to the end of your string and the stack isn't empty, then your brackets are incomplete, so that's part 2.

From there it's just a question of calculating the scores, and bookkeeping to get the final answers. And reading closely enough to notice that part 1 wants the _sum_ of the scores, while part 2 wants the _median_ of the scores.
