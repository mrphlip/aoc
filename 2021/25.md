# 25 &ndash; We made it
Ah, and as is tradition, a nice calm puzzle for the 25th to round it all out.

Not a lot to talk about with this puzzle... we maintain a `Map` where the keys are positions of the cucumbers on the grid, and the values are which direction they are moving, to both make it easy to iterate over all the cucumbers each step, and also to easily check whether a given location is empty (and can be moved into). Then it's just a case of moving them all each step, and repeating until no changes are made to the grid.
