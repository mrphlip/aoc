There are many strategies that could be used to identify the different digits here... we could try identifying each segment individually (segment `a` is the only one that appears in the `7` but not in the `1`, for example). Or any of a number of different identifying features of the different digits.

The ones I went with are basically the first ones that came to mind when looking at the shapes of the different digits.

There are three digits that use 5 segments:
* `3` is the only one that uses both of the segments in `1`
* `5` is the only one that uses both of the segments that are in `4` but _not_ in `1`
* `2` is the one that's left after identifying the others

There are three digits that use 6 segments:
* `9` is the only one that uses all of the segments in `4`
* `6` is the only one that _doesn't_ use both of the segments in `1`
* `0` is the one that's left after identifying the others

I'm sure there are other, possibly simpler ways to identify them, but defining it all in terms of subsets (and other set operations) was an easy and clean way to build it all up.
