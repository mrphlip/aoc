# 21 &ndash; Jump for joy
Not too complex here &ndash; just need to write the appropriate programs for the two robots.

For part B, the logic is basically trying to determine "if I jump now, can I see that I'm guaranteed screwed" and if so, it doesn't jump... but if there's a route it can see that would take it to beyond its sensor range, it assumes everything is fine. And it seems that this logic is good enough to pass the test.

The full expression for part B we're implementing is:
```
J = (not A || not B || not C) && D && (H || (E && I) || (E && F))
```
In order, those terms are:
* There is a hole coming up
* There's somewhere for us to land
* Once we land, we can either:
  * Jump again immediately
  * Take one step and them jump, or
  * Take two steps (at which point our jump would take us outside sensor range)

However, implementing that logic within the architecture provided, given it has multiple nested operations and we only have one temp register, was not trivial, but some amount of rearranging got us there.
