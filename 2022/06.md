# 6 &ndash; Sliding Doors
Pretty simple puzzle today... asks you to do a thing, so you just do the thing.

In theory, the algorithm here could be improved... if this puzzle was showing up later in the event, I'd expect that the second part would need you to scan for a _much_ longer substring (to the point that the O(n&sup2;) behaviour of the basic solution is too much)... and you could do it (keep track of a multiset of what letters are in your sliding window, and then you only need to update it for the one letter being added and the one letter being removed each step). But that wasn't needed here, as the 14-letter case is still solved by the naive solution in a matter of milliseconds.

For the race, I did have one hiccup as while I was skim-reading the requirements, I missed the part that explained exactly what number you need to enter at the end... like, if you have to skip the first three letters, and then the following four letters are your token, then is the answer 3? 4? 7? Turns out it's 7, but trying to figure that out from just the examples while in a half-panic took longer than it probably should have.
