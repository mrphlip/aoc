# 8 &ndash; Towers
Doing this puzzle for the race, I got trapped by puzzles like [Towers](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/towers.html) that count the number of visible towers from each cardinal direction along each line, in exactly this way... so naturally that's how I thought about approaching it. But doing it this way is quite fiddly... I have a lot of copy/pasted code for each of the four directions, and also need to keep track of which trees I have already counted (as a tree that's visible in multiple directions should not be double-counted).

This then leads into the second part of the puzzle, which is completely different... I was confused for a bit that it wasn't doing the "visible if it's the tallest we've seen so far" thing when figuring out visibility from the targetted tree, and when I did manage to figure out that wasn't happening I ended up having to build something that looked completely unrelated to the work in the first part.

On the other hand, when revisiting this for the Haskell solution, since I knew what was coming, I could approach it from that direction both times &ndash; for each tree, check the visibility range in each direction, and then for the first part we check if any of those visibility ranges reaches the edge of the map, and for the second part we take the product and look for the maximum. This strategy is almost certainly less efficient, but it's a lot cleaner code-wise as it's working from the point-of-view where the two halves of the puzzle are related.
