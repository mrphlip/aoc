# 18 &ndash; Minecraft at home
A welcome reprieve from the last couple of days... everyone was expecting a hard one here, day 18 has been a difficulty spike in the past, and we were on a weekend... but this was a nice break.

First part is pretty simple... for each cell in the input, check each of its 6 sides, and if there isn't another cell in that direction, count them up.

Second part is quite more involved, we need to know which cells outside our shape are path-connected to the exterior. The strategy I went with was to box in an bounding box around our shape, with a buffer on all sides, and then run a flood-fill algorithm to mark all the cells on the exterior, and then we can tell which faces of the surface are on the exterior and which are not.

The flood-fill in my Python race code is a bit janky... I wasn't paying the closest attention so my todo list is actually being used as a stack, rather than a queue... which means the flood fill is running as a depth-first search, rather than a breadth-first search, which is not the most efficient. Still works just fine, but is slower. Meanwhile for the Haskell version I looked into a new module I hadn't worked with before, to get a proper FIFO queue going (since bare lists are not ideal for that sort of thing).
