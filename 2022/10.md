# 10 &ndash; Not-tari 2600
I'm glad they linked the [Racing the Beam video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFnWZH5FXc) in the prose for this one, because if not I would definitely have been speculating that they had watched this video and based the puzzle around it.

Decided pretty early on in this one that I wanted to flatten the operations to a full list of what is in the register at each clock cycle... so each `noop` would add one value to this list, and each `addx` would add two values. Make it much easier to keep track of what is happening at any given time. This definitely turned out to be the right call, after reading the second part. One judicious application of `scanl` and this list fell out right how we wanted it.

There was definitely some confusion about indexing... the first part wants us to index the timestamps starting at 1, while the second part indexes the screen pixels starting at 0... but after re-reading it several times to ensure that, yes, that is actually what they want, the rest just mostly fell out as hoped.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to participate in the race for this one.
