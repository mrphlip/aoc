# 4 &ndash; Out of bounds
Another classic puzzle here, of intersecting ranges. The trick, for those unaware, is that if you have two ranges (call them `a-b` and `x-y`), the only way they can _not_ intersect is to have one entirely to one side of the other, ie `b < x || a > y`. So the intersection condition is the reverse of this: `b >= x && a <= y`. Much simpler than testing for different combinations of the various ways that two ranges can intersect.

Unfortunately, when I was coding for the race, I didn't call those ranges `a-b` and `x-y`, but rather one of the first lines of code I wrote was
```py
for w,x,y,z in dat:
```
which... didn't help, I absolutely could not keep all those letters straight, and that lead to me having a typo where I used the wrong variable in one condition and got the wrong answer out. Another minute in sad baby jail for me, and another miss at the leaderboards, entirely due to my own over-hasty coding. Live and learn.
