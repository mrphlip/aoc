# 3 &ndash; Set theory
This one went real smooth during the race, using `set` operations. Reimplementing it Haskell using the builtin `intersect` gave me a little trouble at first, because I didn't realise that the one letter that was shared between the two strings could be in them multiple times, so `intersect` would return it multiple times (since it's an operation on lists, rather than on sets)... but once I figured that out, adding a call to `nub` fixed it right up.
