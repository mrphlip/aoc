# 25 &ndash; Balanced Quinary
Once more, another puzzle where I'm helped out by having looked into this sort of thing before... not this exact thing, but [balanced ternary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary) which is a similar idea. With that under my belt, this was all pretty simple to churn out. But ultimately, the day-25 puzzles usually aren't too complicated, let people get the puzzle out of the way and on with their christmas day.

[11/9], which puts me with a total of 1976 points for the event. The highest score of anyone who got under 2000 points! Or, more usefully, overall rank 22. Which I'm very happy with, it's a super solid showing.
