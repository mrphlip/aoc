# 5 &ndash; Towers of Hanoi
Lots of shuffling and list slicing here, but nothing surprising as yet.

One thing I did find interesting is that my solution here is working with lists and pulling off each move in one go using list slices... which means that to get the solution for part B, all I had to do was _remove_ the part of the code that reverses the sublist being moved between the two piles. Meanwhile, I see solutions from other people that are using some specific Stack datastructure, and doing the moves as explicit push/pop operations, and they had to _add_ code for part B to unreverse the list that is already being naturally reversed by that strategy. It's interesting that these two strategies disagree over which part of the puzzle is "simpler".

The hard part for this puzzle, it seems universally agreed, is actually reading the input data... specifically the initial state of the stacks. For the race, I went half-measures by using text-editor tricks to remove all the square brackets and spacing, to be left with just a simple grid of letters and spaces, and then used actual code to transpose that into a list of stacks. Meanwhile for the more careful Haskell solution I actually parse it fully, using fancy parser-combinator tricks, I'm actually quite happy with how simple the parser ended up looking.
