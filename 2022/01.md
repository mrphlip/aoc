# 1 &ndash; Getting sorted
Ah, new year, new advent calendar, time to stretch these code-racing muscles again. What fun.

While I've done AoC for a few years now, this is the first year where I've actually remembered in time to be here for the start of the event, so it's the first time I've actually attempted the leaderboard race on day 1. And... I probably _should_ have realised that the day-1 problem statement starts with several paragraphs of flavour text about the puzzles, and the stars, and whatnot, that I should quickly skip past when racing, I did not in fact realise this ahead of time... so I spent longer than necessary skimming through several paragraphs looking for the parts that are important to the puzzle and getting worried that I wasn't seeing anything. And when even 100th place on the leaderboard is finished in 2 minutes flat, that's not time you can waste.

Regardless, it was a fun experience and I'll be better prepared next year.

I was also a bit rusty and tried to write file-parsing code in my Python race submission, forgetting that my usual strategy is to just copy-paste my input value into the text editor (and possibly use some text-editor tools to pre-process it into a useful form) so I hit some unexpected hurdles with the blank lines and had to debug that (ended up just throwing a `if the line isn't blank` clause in the parser).

Ready and looking forward to what the rest of the month brings!
