# 2 &ndash; The King's game
Ah, RPS, a classic. What I quickly realised is that I could use mod-3 arithmetic to quickly figure out who the winner was. What I was less immediately clever about was how to turn the input letters into numbers to do those calculations.

Like, by thought process was pretty clearly "OK, I need the values to end up as `0`, `1` or `2`, so I'll type in those numbers, and then I'll pick it based on what letters show up"... except then the resulting code looked like
```py
l = [0,1,2][ord(l) - ord('A')]
r = [0,1,2][ord(r) - ord('X')]
```
which... like... it works? But come on, brain, I thought you were better than this.

For part 2, I managed to get it done very quickly, with one extra line of code... but unfortunately, when typing that code, I made a typo (I put a `-` sign instead of a `%` in the formula) and it got me the wrong answer. So I hit the "you have to wait a minute before guessing again" page on the website. I'd submitted at the 0:05:21 mark, so if I hadn't made that mistake, I believe I would have come 38th for part 2 (and gotten 63 points). But alas.

For the Haskell version, I'm using enums for everything, because type-safety... but in the function bodies I'm still dropping back to ints and using modular arithmetic, because it's a lot shorter to type in than doing it case-by-case with lookup tables.
