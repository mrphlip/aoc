# 6 &ndash; Tree building
All pretty simple here, just building up a tree (which in this case is a map from each node to its parent, because we never need to worry about iterating a node's children), and keeping track of each node's depth. Part A is just the sum of the depths of every node in the tree.

Part B is just a case of finding the depth of the deepest common ancestor of the two target nodes, and then measuring the length of the path from source, to ancestor, to destination. Minus 2, because we're really wanting to measure the distance between the direct parents of the source and destination.
