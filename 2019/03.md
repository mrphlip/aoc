# 3 &ndash; Crossing guard
Pretty simple algorithm here &ndash; build a list of all the points each wire touches, convert each list to a set, get the intersection, find the closest.

Or, at least, that was the plan until the second part, as now each point in the wire needs to know how far along the wire it is, and now the two points on the two wires aren't equal.

At first I tried doing this with a simple loop through each list, but the O(nÂ²) loops were taking too long on the full puzzle data. I ended up figuring out a way to do it with a Map where the coordinates are keys and the wire lengths are values &ndash; which still lets us find intersections efficiently, and then add the lengths together, with the magic of `intersectionWith (+)`.

As an aside, I've been working with Python for too long... _every_ time I use `minimumBy` or `sortBy` or suchlike, I try to pass a function like Python's `list.sort(key=func)` parameter... it always takes me seeing the compiler error to remember the equivalent is ``sortBy (compare `on` func)``, not `sortBy func`.
