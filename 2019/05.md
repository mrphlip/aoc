# 5 &ndash; Input and Output
A whole bunch of extra features to be added to the Intcode interpreter today.

Handling the IO has been a bit of an interesting puzzle on how to retrofit it in to the system. A more ideomatic way would probably have been to have any inputs passed as a parameter to `icstep` and have the outputs as an extra return value from it (plus, I guess, some sort of flag to indicate whether the input was consumed). And then have `icrun` pass in the inputs and collect the outputs as needed. However that would add a fair amount of complication to the framework that seemed like it would be a problem (and was more than I could keep in mind at once) so instead I went with the solution of having the lists of inputs and outputs stored as part of the machine state.

The outputs as part of the machine state have been a problem, though... I don't want to just append new outputs to the end of the list, as that would be O(nÂ²) given the single-linked list structure. At first I tried appending new outputs to the front of the list, and then just reversing it when the machine was complete. However, that meant we couldn't lazy-read outputs from the machine &ndash; it would have to fully complete before any outputs could be read. That works for now, but will be a problem in the future.

All the other complications &ndash; immediate-mode addressing, comparison and branch instructions, were all pretty simple to add to the machine as it was.
