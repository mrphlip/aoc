# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

I use these types of challenges as an excuse to learn (or brush up on) programming languages I'm not particularly familiar with. This time around: Haskell.

So don't expect this code to be particularly efficient, clean, or idiomatic.

But, it works.

For each puzzle, eg `01.hs` is my code, and `01.txt` is my version of the data file from AOC. `01.md` is my comments on the puzzle, and my solution for it. Some common code between the puzzles has been collected in `Intcode.hs` and `../Utils.hs`.
