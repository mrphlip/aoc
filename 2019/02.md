# 2 &ndash; First taste of Intcode
And here we get our first crack at what's seeming to be the big throughline to these puzzles (at least so far... for context I started writing this journal around puzzle 10ish).

The main structure of the interpreter is pretty simple so far... build a type to hold the machine's state, and a function to run one instruction of the machine, and then we can unfold that function to run the entire machine. So far, that structure has worked out ok for us, with only having had to add new instructions to the main body, and a few more fields to the machine state as time goes on.

Part B of this puzzle also served as my first case of being super cautious with the Intcode interpreter and error checking and suchlike... since a number of the sample programs it had provided for testing purposes had involved self-modifying code, or the like, I was suspecting that it might be possible for some combinations of inputs to end up with illegal opcodes, or out-of-bounds array accesses, so I looked into Haskell's exception-catching utils, so I could catch any attempted inputs that caused an exception and continue on to the next. Looking back, I doubt this was necessary, and it's not something I've really done again &ndash; my strategy going forward is basically "just try to run the program we've been given as-is, and worry about exceptions if and when it becomes necessary".

Learning the basics of exceptions has been good, though, because it's let me make add the `tests` block (which I also retrofitted into puzzle 1). It's still generally more convenient to test the functions by running them with various options from `gchi` while developing, but the tests are still useful to codify as a double-check that nothing breaks while I'm working on other things.

As an aside: I'm dreading the day where the puzzle is "write an Intcode program that does a thing" instead of "run this Intcode program we've provided"...
