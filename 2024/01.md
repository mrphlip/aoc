Ah, Advent of Code time again, one of my favourite times of year.

Easing it off with a pretty simple puzzle, as usual. The code I put together here is pretty directly taking the requirements from the puzzle as written, and turning them directly into code.

The result isn't the most efficient... for part 2, I think it might be cleaner to run `Counter`s over _both_ input lists, and iterate over the intersection... the actual calculation you're doing is, in fact, symmetric between the two lists, it's just not described that way in the puzzle statement. So what I wrote is as written, where you iterate through one list, and count how many matching entries there are in the second list.

I did lose a little bit of time on part 2 from re-reading the puzzle multiple times, I was sure I was missing some detail, but no, I read it right the first time.

I also lost a little thinking about how `Counter` works... specifically, whether `counter[x]` returns `0` if there are no `x`s in the count, or if it raises `KeyError`... I guessed it _probably_ returned `0`, but I wasn't completely certain. But I quickly decided that the fastest option was just to use `counter.get(x, 0)` anyway, even though it was a little bit of extra typing, it was faster than spending the time to _check_ how it worked. Turns out, it wasn't necessary, as it does return `0`, but I feel good about making that choice in the moment.
