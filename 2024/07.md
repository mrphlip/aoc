# 7 &ndash; 

Second day in a row where brute force still works, but on the borderline, with runtimes in the tens of seconds.

Just directly throwing it all together, using `itertools.product` to generate a list of possible operator combinations, and then evaluating each one to see if it works. Quite fast for the part 1, but slow enough to be a concern for part 2.

There were certainly optimisations to be had... on one hand, if evaluating an expression didn't work, and then all that's changed is the last operator, then really it should only need to recalculate that last step, but I have it recalculating the entire expression from the start every time. On the other hand, all three of the operators can only increase the value, so if the accumulated value is ever larger than the target, it could in theory bail out early and not bother evaluating any of the operator options after that point.

Even better would be to try to solve it from the outside in... like, if the target value isn't a multiple of the last operand, then the last operator can't be `*`. And if the target value doesn't end with the same digits as the last operand, then the last operator can't be `||`. So that limits your options for that last operator, iterate through _those_ and work backwards to figure out a new target value for the second-last operator, and recurse.

But in the moment, didn't do any of that, and we're still at the point in the event where I can get away with that.
