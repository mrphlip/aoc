# 4 &ndash; Do (not) find the Xmas

I thought had a bit of a head-start on this one, as I already had a handy function for unrolling a wordsearch, from a previous project doing some statistical analysis of the "Do not find the fox" game played on YouTube by [AlexCheddarUK](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexCheddarUK/shorts). Unfortunately, it took me a minute to track it down, as I had a couple of different versions of the thing, as I'd made some changes for different parts of that project, and I had to find the one that had the features I needed (works on a 2D grid, not a flattened list, and used a generic `SIZE` constant instead of having it hard-coded). But I still think this was faster than trying to re-write it from scratch.

This function pulls out all of the rows, columns, and both diagonals, as a single long string, which can then be searched through to find all of the relevant words. Have to check for `XMAS` and `SAMX` separately, of course, since it's only pulling out each row/col/etc once, not in both directions.

For part 2, I throw all of that away and do a scan through for the particular shape we're after. I search through the grid looking for `A`s, and then use `set` magic to check that both of the corners on each diagonal contain both an `M` and an `S` (in either order). This strategy came together pretty quickly.
