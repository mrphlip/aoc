# 18 &ndash; Pathfinding 101

Well, that was unexpected. After the difficulty spike yesterday, I was expecting today's puzzle to go in a quite different, more difficult direction... I was sure part 2 was going to be something along the lines of "each step you take through the maze, an additional tile becomes corrupted, how quickly can you get through this ever-shifting maze?" They've done similar puzzles [before](../2022/24.md), after all.

But no, part 2 still doesn't have us trying to pathfind through a changing maze, just repeatedly doing pathfind solves through different static mazes, to find which ones are solvable.

For part 1, I yet again use a hastily thrown-together Dijkstra's solver. Though, given we're walking through a grid one step at a time, a simple BFS would have been sufficient.

For part 2, we reuse the Dijkstra's solver to check if the maze is solvable (but now we don't care about how long it takes, so this is overkill, a simple floodfill algorithm would be more than enough) and do a binary search to find the cutoff where it goes from solveable to unsolveable.

Bing bang bosh, and we're done in time for tea.
