# 1 &ndash; Some simple number crunching
Nothing too exciting here, as expected for the first puzzle.

Though, part B did finally give me a reason to learn how to use `unfoldr` which was neat.

Also, I spent an amount of time beating my head against a misreading for part B that each module did the full recursive fuel chain individually, and _then_ you add them all up. I misread that each module had its own fuel, but then you do the recursive fuel tail on the entire fuel load as a single unit, which (naturally) gave me the wrong answer, and it took me a little while to figure out what I was doing wrong.
