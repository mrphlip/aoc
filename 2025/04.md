# 4 &ndash; They see me rollin'

Another day, another simple one. All my time in previous AoCs helped out here, with plenty of practice working on these stuff-in-a-grid puzzles.

The primary lesson being: don't store it as a big grid, as an array of `bool`s... instead, store it as a `set` of locations. Makes it easier to, eg, iterate over the objects, and check for neighbours without having to bounds-check against the size of the grid.

So, for part 1, we just go through each roll, and use a set intersection to quickly extract all of its neighbours, and count how many there are. For part 2, we just directly work as described, repeatedly removing all the ones that can be removed, until we do a pass that doesn't find any removable, then count how many were removed in total. Nice and easy.

Only real small optimisation is that, instead of checking that the _neighbours_ of any given roll are _less than_ 4, I instead check the entire 3x3 range around it (including itself) is _less than or equal to_ 4. Same result, but slightly simpler to do.
