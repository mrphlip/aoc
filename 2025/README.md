# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

The global leaderboard may be a thing of the past, but I still enjoy the feel of the race, so these are still going to be speed-written solutions (with all of that implies for, say, legibility).

However, that means that this year I'll be recording my times for each puzzle, rather than my leaderboard rank.
