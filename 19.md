# Following the beams
Another puzzle where I'm making some simplifying assumptions based on my input...

Part A is pretty simple, just measure the various locations and count up the returns.

For part B, though, I worked from first looking at the plot and approximating the angles by hand - one edge of the beam is slightly to the left of 45 degrees, and the other edge is somewhere further to the left of that. So we only look in that direction on each line to figure out where to expect the beam to be. And this, combined with some hand-checked endpoints for the binary search gives us a solution that will only really work for my input values.
