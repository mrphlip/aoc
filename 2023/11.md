# 11 &ndash; Elfie In the Sky with Galaxies
Whenever these puzzles present me with a big massive grid like this, with a bunch of info scattershot across it, my first instict is to extract all of the relevant information into a flat list. In this case, a list of all the gridpoints that contain a galaxy. In practise it seems that having the information in that form so often turns out to be easier to work with for these types of puzzles.

In this case, it meant that the step of "expanding space" just involved adding a correction to the coordinates of all of these galaxies... as opposed to what I suspect is the trap solution, which is to actually add additional blank rows to the grid.

This meant that for part 2, it was a simple case of adding a multiplying factor to that correction, to make it expand by more (though it did take me a few moments of thought to realise that this multiplying factor needed to be `999999`, not `1000000`). As opposed to adding millions of blank rows and columns to this grid.

Realising that the "shortest path" search you had to do was just basic taxicab distance, and you weren't expected to do any sort of pathfinding, also helped.
