# 16 &ndash; Flashbacks of Aargon
Another pretty straightforward one. Not that I'm complaining when the weekend ones are easier, it makes my scheduling a lot easier.

Part 1 was just a case of following the directions as given, and tracing the path of the beam through the grid. The puzzle was vague about what needed to be the "end state" of the simulation... the obvious first guess is that it ends when all the beams exit the grid, but the existence of the "splitter" tiles (which aren't reversible) means that there is no guarantee that this process will actually end. Like, this simple setup has a beam bouncing around in a loop forever:
```
|-
-|
```
However, it is all deterministic, so if we've already processed a beam at a particular location in a particular direction, then a later beam at the same location in the same direction isn't going to cause any _additional_ tiles to be energised, so we can ignore it. Essentially a flood-fill algorithm, keep track of everywhere we've been, and break the loop if we revisit anywhere.

For part 2, I didn't immediately see any particular opportunities to speed it up... there was probably some amount of memoisation that could be done, but I didn't see anything immediate. So I just threw together the obvious, just testing each entry point individually and compare them. And I let that run while I tried to think of a faster way to do it... and it finished pretty quickly, before I came up with anything.
