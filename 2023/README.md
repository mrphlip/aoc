# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

After previous years, I'm taking a break from using AoC to try to learn another language, as the pattern of solving the problem in a language I know for the leaderboard race, and then solving it again in the language I'm trying to learn, just wasn't working for me. I can only really do one or the other, and I'm choosing to do the leaderboard race. So only garbage thrown-together Python implementations here this year.
