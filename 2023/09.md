# 9 &ndash; This puzzle seems derivative
I don't have a lot to say about this puzzle, honestly. Both parts of the puzzle were just, write code to do exactly what the puzzle said to do, in exactly the way the puzzle said to do it. No particular need for any analysis or any fancy optimisations.

There were some things you could do. Like, for instance, you could solve part 2 by simply reversing the input lists and then passing them to the code from part 1, rather than modifying your code to do the new thing. But even that really wasn't necessary as the changes weren't that severe.

You could even go the full maths route, and notice that what they're getting you to do is find a polynomial fit through all of the provided points, and then evaluating that at the next point. So you could do that directly in another way. But this too, was overkill for the problem at hand.
