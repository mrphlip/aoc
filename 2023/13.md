# 13 &ndash; Mirror, mirror, in the maze...
I think I got a bit too clever for my own good here.

I tried to get real fancy with the comparisons, I thought I'd save dev time by using string comparisons rather than writing the nested loops to check every cell individually. So like, instead of doing:
```py
for y in range(...):
  for x in range(...):
    x2, y2 = reflected point
    if grid[y2][x2] != grid[y][x]:
      do whatever
```
I thought I could do something roughly like:
```py
for y in range(...):
  y2 = reflected coordinate
  if grid[y2] != grid[y]:
    do whatever
# or
for y in range(...):
  if grid[y][:x] != grid[y][x:][::-1]:
    do whatever
```
except keeping track of all the intricacies of extracting the correct substrings, and iterating over the correct ranges, all got a bit much, and ironing out all the bugs took a lot longer than it really should have. While the direct loop would likely have been much simpler (and been easier to adapt to part 2).

Ah well, live and learn.
