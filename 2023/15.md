# 15 &ndash; Stay focused
Have I sung the praises of the Python `collections` module yet this event? I'm pretty sure I have. But still, and again, all hail the Python `collections` module.

Because, while part 1 of this was pretty straightforward, just implement the hash function as described... part 2 had a _lot_ of words spent on detailing the mechanics of how these hash buckets need to work... how they're ordered, with new items going on the end, but items can also be modified in-place without reordering, and items can be removed, which pulls them out of the ordering...

And that just so happens to be _exactly_ the semantics of `collections.OrderedDict`, across the board.

The hardest part of the whole thing was just keeping track of which parts of the puzzle used zero-indexed lists and which parts used one-indexed, because of course the puzzle used both. For the same list.
